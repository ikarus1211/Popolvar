# Popolvar

This was one of my first big school assignments.
It was created by my professor and its main focus is on algorithms and graph or space search in multiple dimensions.

The focus was to search in 2D+ space and the shortest path to save the princes from dragons â˜º. 

The code itself is not as pretty and readable as I hoped. 
As good students, as we were me and my friends sat in our study hall for 20 +/- hours drinking Red Bull and watching Naruto as a reward for every bug we fixed.
This was our first taste of propper programming.
We managed to fulfill the assignment at the max score.
