# Popolvar

This was one of my first big school assignments.
It was created by my professor and its main focus is on algorithms and graph or space search in multiple dimensions.

The focus was to search in 2D+ space and the shortest path to save the princes from dragons â˜º. 

The code itself is not as pretty and readable as I hoped.
